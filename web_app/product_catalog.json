      "description": "The Daikin AC 1.8 Ton - Hot and Cold Inverter - 3 Star - Split AC - FTHT60UV16U and RHT60UV16U - Copper Condenser has an airflow volume of up to 420CFM, making it an excellent choice for spaces up to 210Sq.Ft. Moreover, thanks to its fast cooling, this split air conditioner makes sure that your room cools down quickly and efficiently, providing relief from the heat within minutes of turning on the AC. Buy original Daikin AC 1.8 Ton - Hot and Cold Inverter - 3 Star - Split AC - FTHT60UV16U and RHT60UV16U - Copper Condenser at wholesale prices from Better Home. Hepta Sense Daikin Swing Inverter ACs has 7 Sensors located on IDU and ODU. Each of these sensors has role to play in the working of Air conditioner that improves overall performance, provide comfort to users and help to increase durability and life of the AC. 3 Stage Filtration The 3 Stage Air Filtration process captures micro dust particles and eliminates pollutants airborne pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, mould, and fungi to make the indoor air clean, safe, and fresh. Functions from -10degC to 54degC Provides you comfort in scorching summer to chilling winters. The ac operates from -10degC to 54degC. Auto Vairable Speed Daikins inverter AC comes with Patented Swing Compressor Technology that constantly adjusts the compressors speed to maintain optimum cooling even in extreme temperatures. The advanced inverter AC is equipped with smart sensors both in indoor and outdoor units. They automatically sense any change in temperature and continuously monitor the working of critical components, communicating the same to the super Printed Circuit Board PCB. Dew Clean Technology Dew Clean Technology is a one button operation, that, when activated, automatically cleans the evaporator coil of the indoor unit heat exchanger by utilizing condensate water. This allows for better cleaning of Indoor Unit Heat Exchanger which ensures better airflow consistent cooling performance throughout the year. Triple Display Are you sure inverter ACs, save money Daikins inverter technology is best in class because it has the widest range of compressor frequencies. You can witness the same with Daikins triple display feature. It enables you to witness power saving due to inverter technology in form of estimated power consumption percentage of your AC in at any given point in time, on real time basis along with setroom temperature and error code. Air Throw upto 16 meters With the Cross Flow Evaporator Fans, Daikin Air Conditioners ensure uniform cooling and a powerful air-flow that allows one to receive the cool air up to 16 meters 52 Feet away from the unit. The unique Cross Flow Evaporator Fans and Power Airflow Dual Flaps help in cooling down all sorts of spaces, big and small. Moreover, they help to ensure uniform cooling and deliver peace of mind. DNNS Self Heal Every Daikin Room ACs Indoor Unit U-bend side is coated with advanced anti-corrosive coating active agent DNNS Di-Nonyl Nephthalene Sulfonic Acid. The coating has Self Healing properties that activates upon chipping, scratches due to environmental or chemical pollution.",
