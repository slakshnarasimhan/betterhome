The advanced inverter AC is equipped with smart sensors both in indoor and outdoor units. They automatically sense any change in temperature and continuously monitor the working of critical components, communicating the same to the super Printed Circuit Board PCB. Dew Clean Technology Dew Clean Technology is a one button operation, that, when activated, automatically cleans the evaporator coil of the indoor unit heat exchanger by utilizing condensate water. This allows for better cleaning of Indoor Unit Heat Exchanger which ensures better airflow consistent cooling performance throughout the year. Triple Display Are you sure inverter ACs, save money Daikins inverter technology is best in class because it has the widest range of compressor frequencies. You can witness the same with Daikins triple display feature. It enables you to witness power saving due to inverter technology in form of estimated power consumption percentage of your AC in at any given point in time, on real time basis along with setroom temperature and error code. Air Throw upto 16 meters With the Cross Flow Evaporator Fans, Daikin Air Conditioners ensure uniform cooling and a powerful air-flow that allows one to receive the cool air up to 16 meters 52 Feet away from the unit. The unique Cross Flow Evaporator Fans and Power Airflow Dual Flaps help in cooling down all sorts of spaces, big and small. Moreover, they help to ensure uniform cooling and deliver peace of mind. DNNS Self Heal Every Daikin Room ACs Indoor Unit U-bend side is coated with advanced anti-corrosive coating active agent DNNS Di-Nonyl Nephthalene Sulfonic Acid. The coating has Self Healing properties that activates upon chipping, scratches due to environmental or chemical pollution.",
